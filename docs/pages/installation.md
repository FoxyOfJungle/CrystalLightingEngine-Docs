## Installation Tutorial <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This quick guide will show you how to download and install Crystal in your project.

### Download the purchased file from store.

Log into your Itch.io or Marketplace account and download the files.

### If purchased from Itch.io:

You received a .yymps and a .yyz file.  
* The **.yymps** file is a "Local Package" file, it will only contain the Crystal folder alone, without any examples, ready to use in a new or existing game.  
* The **.yyz** file contains the GameMaker project, which will contain the Crystal and all the examples, among others (Release Notes + Readme).  

### To import the **.yymps** file to your game, go to menu:  
**Tools > Import Local Package**

A new window will open, now just do this:

### To import the **.yyz** file with examples, go to menu:  
**File > Import Project**

![Installation](/../images/Installation_1.png)

This way, you will be able to view examples of using Crystal.
